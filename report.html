   <h1>MY REPORT </h1> 

   <h1>INTRODUCTION </h1> 

<p>This report chronicles the journey of learning the fundamentals of web development, the highs and lows of the learning process, the design choices made, and the module's reflection. 

I was able to grasp and comprehend the fundamentals of web development and making ideas a reality through the study of this subject. This module required all new code, so the journey was not simple to complete. It was novel since it was simple to use and made use of frame works such as booststrap. This led to the creation of notions that were ultimately cause for concern. Debugging wasn't simple because it seemed like nothing was being archived on a daily basis. Using media queries to make the website responsive was also a significant challenge. </p>

<h1>TECHNICAL AND USER INTERFACE </h1> 

<p></p>The user interface required careful consideration of several factors, including layout, colours, fonts, tags, and appearance. Although it was advised that the CSS Grid be used for the project's layouts, not all of the pages could be completed in that way, such as the form page. In this section, CSS Flex was utilised instead. This project also included animation background, which was animated with the use of keyframes and transitions. Nour Ibram provided the backdrop animation (source Codepen).  </p>

<h1> REFLECTION  </h1> 

<p>I believed that I would have performed far better on this project if time management had been followed, as time was wasted on debugging rather than conducting additional research to improve the website. It's a pretty lovely model, but it's also quite difficult. </p>

<h1>CONCULISION </h1> 

<P>Developing webpages and websites using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages is known as web development. I was able to grasp the fundamentals of web development and designing websites in this subject by bringing concepts to life. Working on a project like this requires a lot of skill, particularly when it comes to making the website responsive.  </P>
